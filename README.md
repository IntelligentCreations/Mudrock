[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/IntelligentCreations/Mudrock?style=for-the-badge&include_prereleases&sort=semver)][releases]

</div>

Mudrock is a simple library used by Intelligent Creations.

It is built on the [Fabric][fabric] and [Forge][forge] mod loader and is available for modern
versions of [Minecraft][minecraft] Java Edition.

## Features

* A simple registry system for creating multiple simple items and blocks. **(WIP in Architectury versions)**
* Basic event listeners. They work as intermediaries between Forge and Fabric. ~~*We like Mixin, but the less Mixin, the better, right?*~~
